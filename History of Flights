HISTORY OF FLIGHTS
Note: Parenthesis comments are made by Tyler Chang

flight 1 = bad landing
flight 2 = bad landing
flight 3 = bad landing
flight 4 = better landing
flight 5 = good landing, but failed roll and pitch
flight 6 = good landing, but failed roll and light change
flight 7 = failed roll and color change, would have had a good landing, but I put my hand underneath it and then it
went crazy and I had to emergency shut it off.
flight 8 = best landing so far, but still failed light change and roll. Light change removed. Changed roll
flight 9 = Landed in the same spot it took off! roll slightly successful
flight 10 = roll change was a failure, and it failed to land correctly, and was caught by some wires and thankfully
didn't hit the ground.
flight 11 = after takeoff, it pitched forward hard and the I had to recue it before it crash landed
flight 12 =  MANNED! Tried to flip drone and failed, should have read instructions first before
the attempt. Landing failed.
flight 13 = AUTO! I tried to make the drone yaw, but it failed. But there was a successful landing
flight 14 = MANNED! Tried to flip again, it was chaos, with about 6 drones in the air. Collided
with napkin and crashed
flight 15 = MANNED! Tried to flip again, failed. Drone crashed into a brick, and it was knocked
into my backpack.
flight 16 = MANNED!  Successful flip, but when the drone tried to land, it hit the side of the
landing pad and crashed onto the floor
flight 17 = AUTO FLIGHT WITHOUT CONTROLLER! The flip would have worked, but the drone was right up against the wall,
so it fell and crashed
flight 18  = Good takeoff, but then flew into the wall again and crashed. I think I fixed the roll?
flight 19 = Nope, didn't fix the error
flight 20 = NOPE, didn't fix the error even though I turned the drone the other way!
flight 21 =  STILL NOT WORKING!! Maybe it will be better tomorrow. 21 Flights today!!

DAY 2
flight 22 = MANNED! Landed on a moving box! Box was less than 1x1 feet!
flight 23 = MANNED! Killed by Tyler's foot
flight 24 = MANNED! killed by flying into computer and crashing
flight 25 = MANNED! landed successfully after dodging Tyler's hits.(NOOOOO)
flight 26 = AUTO! This was a test flight (first of the day). After takeoff, automatically
banked to the right and hit wall. After this is tried to do a flip and crashed.
flight 27 = This time, the drone banked far to the left, and had to be rescued. I learned you have to put the trim
after the takeoff.
flight 28 = Banked to the left and backwards, had to be rescued.
flight 29 = Banked to the right and forwards this time, had to be rescued
flight 30 = Successful trim and landing! Time to try a flip
flight 31 = Successful flip! had to be bonked a few times in the right direction, but landed perfectly!
flight 32 = Interesting flight. It banked to far to the right, but managed to do a flip and land without crashing on
Tyler's desk!! (sus)
flight 33 = Successful trim, landing, and flip!
flight 34 = Trying to roll the drone again, not sure what happened. Everything was fine, but I didn't see a roll.
flight 35 = Drone doesn't seem to do much in a roll, I am going to read more.
flight 36 = Tried to try roll & pitch, doesn't seem to do anything. Setting them to full power.
flight 37 = Seems to pitch on landing, still no sign of roll
flight 38 = accidentally ran the code and stopped it mid way, so drone had to be rescued.
flight 39 = I finally saw the pitch, but it still is turning on landing and I have no idea why.

DAY 3
flight 40 = MANNED!  me and tyler were fighting with our drones and managed to hit without crashing! (sus)
flight 41 = MANNED! I was trying to annoy tyler with my drone and then it crashed. (because yes)
flight 42 = MANNED!  I landed my drone from about 6 meters away, a far landing successful!
flight 43 = MANNED!  I tried to take off from the table but hit some box of tissues.
flight 44 = MANNED!  drone emergency landed because it had no battery.
flight 45 = MANNED!   I was trying to annoy tyler again with a drone.
flight 46 = MANNED!  I was flying the drone sideways but it was too confusing.
flight 47 = AUTO!  Everything successful, but landed on another student.
flight 48 = MANNED!  flew drone over to tyler then landed on keyboard and crashed.
flight 49 = MANNED!  Did the same thing and then crashed again.
flight 50 = MANNED!  did the same thing again and did a good landing

DAY 4
flight 51 = MANNED! warm up flight, first one of the day!
flight 52 = MANNED! flew the drone around the league classrooms, it was very fun!
flight 53 = MANNED! Flew around the league again, and annoyed tyler with it. I also tried max speed and crashed into
a wall
flight 54 = MANNED! flew it around tyler playing chess and landed on a checkers
flight 55 = MANNED! killed by tyler using a card
flight 56 = MANNED! flew on max speed and failed landing
flight 57 = MANNED! killed by Tyler again!
flight 58 = AUTO! I had to bump the drone around so it wouldn't hit the wall, and it failed the landing, but had a
successful flip!
flight 59 = successful flip, and successful landing!
flight 60 = Interesting flight. The flip worked, and the function I added for the drone to return kind of worked. The
drone landed on my seat, but then fell off. So close! I am going to adjust a few things.
flight 61 = the flip and return worked better this time. The drone landed on my foot, but didn't crash
flight 62 = The drone worked, but it kind of failed the return. I think increasing the time will help maybe
flight 63 = drone kind of worked, the return is giving me problems. This time, it turned right for some reason.
flight 64 = might have gotten the negative and positive roll confused
flight 65 = Kind of confusing flight. the roll has no effect on the flight. Also, it had a weird landing on my hand
flight 66 = Went right into the wall, had to be rescued
flight 67 = ??? the drone flew out of the room, and landed on a pile of stuff.
flight 68 = I changed all the things, but it still went out of the door!!??
flight 69 = aborted because I forgot to change the numbers
flight 70 = Tyler aborted the mission for some reason.
flight 71 = Drone still wants to go out of the door for some reason! had to be rescued after bumping into a window
flight 72 = Drone didn't take off for some reason. Trying again...
flight 73 = Flip was fine, but was kind of brushing up against the wall. Would have landed fine, but I decided to
interfere because I thought it wouldn't.
flight 74 = It looks like the drone was leaning to the right, and it crash landed
flight 75 = I think that the drone does stuff randomly. What works in one flight doesn't work in another. it is
very random. I think that I will never get it perfect, but that is okay. Landing was fine
flight 76 = apparently it looks like fly_circle function doesn't work, because it made a "7" in midair, instead of
a rounded shape. Landed on the Macintosh, and then crashed.
flight 77 = Didn't do a circle again, and landed on Tyler's drone carrier
flight 78 = didn't fly in a circle, and then landed on my face and crashed
flight 79 = for some reason, this time, the drone kind of flew in a circle
flight 80 = This is Tyler speaking, the drone did the flip but then ran into the (BLEEP) wall. Also Nolan tazed
me
flight 81 = I don't know why this doesn't work! it flew so low, and then it flipped into the trash can and crashed
flight 82 = interesting flight, it flew into a wall, and then actually landed itself!
flight 83 = this time, the drone flew to the exact same place and landed itself again, whilst scraping the wall
flight 84 = the drone keeps flying to the wall, have no idea why, I changed everything!
flight 85 = MANNED! I almost landed on tyler's truck. For reference, the truck's trailer is about the size of your
palm. (lier!)
flight 86 = MANNED! I was bullying tyler's drone and failed to land on the truck AGAIN! (nub)
flight 87 = MANNED! I failed to land on the truck. Did a cool flip though
flight 88 = MANNED! crash, failed to land on truck
flight 89 = MANNED! I failed again.
flight 90 = MANNED. this time I crashed into tyler's backpack and then into the truck (noob)
flight 91 = MANNED! LAST TRY!! I was maybe about to do it, but then the drone ran out of battery.
flight 92 = AUTO! was going to the same spot along the wall, so I rescued it.
flight 93 = same result, I might try to fix the trim
flight 94 = Trim fixed! there was a whole lot less drifting, and the drone crash landed on my truck!
flight 95 = for some reason, the drone decided to get stuck in the ceiling, and then crash on another person's desk
flight 96 = slammed into a wall again and had to get rescued.
flight 97 = went to the same wall again and had to be rescued! I don't understand drones
flight 98 = went to the same wall again. AGHAHGAHGAHGHAHGAHGHAGHA
flight 99 = went the opposite direction this time. I am going to eye it and hope it turns out well for flight 100
flight 100 = FLIGHT 100!! The drone started out well, then it started to go awry when it drifted forward. After
that, it did the flip, and then it crashed into the wall, and fell down, but then revived itself! I was relived,
but then it crashed into the side of a desk. That's too bad.

SUMMARY OF FIRST 100 FLIGHTS:
Overall, I learned a lot in these 100 flights. There were a lot of issues, and problems, but that is how you learn.
I started off by crashing the drone manually, but now I can land it pretty reliably, and my coding skills in python
have been sharpened. This was really fun!
